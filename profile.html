    <h2>My projects</h2>
    <h3>Arquihub</h3>
    <p>Here´s our original proposal: Both in architecture and programming, in large projects, we work as a group. There is not yet a way to share files between architects and comment on changes in a centralized way. ARCHIHUB will solve this problem by creating a GitHub for autocad files, where each user can choose their collaborators, share files and upload the different updates. Even working individually, it is important to have a place where you can record the changes and be able to later go back and study the different alternatives or solutions that were proposed. Unlike GitHub, at the moment we will not make updates on the same file but with each "push" the new version of the file will be uploaded. In the image on page 6 (not attached yet) we show one of the possible user dashboards where you can see a general image of the project in the foreground and then the different "commits". On the right side you can see the updates made by the user who owns the repository and on the left a modification by a collaborator. We wanted to emulate a WhatsApp chat where the user sees his and the other person's comments, like a conversation, in the form of a waterfall. At the same time, we offer a space for users to show their work, such as a blog. On page 5 we render another of the user dashboards, with a section where you can see your posts and another where you can see your repositories. On page 7 we propose a form where the user can create a new publication. Once published, it would look like on page 9. To implement the payment gateway we propose to offer a paid membership for professionals and a free option for students. The administrator dashboard (pg 10) will tell you which user has what type of membership, how many publications and repositories they have, and you can also activate and deactivate users. Posts could allow adding comments and a rating system, which will reach post authors as notifications. We may give the admin the ability to review comments before posting or we may filter comments (if they have words we don't want posted), posting only comments that pass the filter. If necessary, we would add a marketplace section, where architects can sell completed works or plans. In principle, ARCHIHUB would serve as a work tool, organizing your files and as a page where you can publish your work and thus connect with potential clients and network.</p>
