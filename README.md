# Projects:

## Arquihub

HereÂ´s our original proposal: Both in architecture and programming, in large projects, we work as a group. There is not yet a way to share files between architects and comment on changes in a centralized way. ARQUIHUB will solve this problem by creating a GitHub for autocad files, where each user can choose their collaborators, share files and upload the different updates. Even working individually, it is important to have a place where you can record the changes and be able to later go back and study the different alternatives or solutions that were proposed. Unlike GitHub, at the moment we will not make updates on the same file but with each "push" the new version of the file will be uploaded. In the image on page 6 (not attached yet) we show one of the possible user dashboards where you can see a general image of the project in the foreground and then the different "commits"...   <a href="https://github.com/BalbianoLuciano/ArchiHub-Front" target="blank">Learn More</a>
